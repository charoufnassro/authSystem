Authentication vs Authorization
Authentication is the act of matching a session with a given user. Example, given a session I can securely identify the user is user_id 123.
Authorization is the act determining if a given user can access a given resource. Example, given two users, an admin and a super admin; admins are authorized to see invoices but canâ€™t delete them; super admins are authorized to see and delete invoices.
